    <p>CBA main purpose is to select suitable safeguard based on the cost and benefit. the cost of control or safeguard include:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Cost of development or acquisition of hardware, software, and services</li>
    <li>Training Fees</li>
    <li>Cost of implementation</li>
    <li>Service costs (e.g. Hiring experts)</li>
    <li>Cost of maintenance (AMC or Annual Subscription) Benefit<br>
    Value to the organization because of loss prevented by using specific controls. Loss is equal to asset value is at risk. Benefit calculation begins with Asset Valuation and Impact</li>
    </ul>
    <h1><a id="What_is_Asset_Valuation_175"></a>What is Asset Valuation?</h1>
    <p>process of assigning financial value or worth to each information asset. This can include actual cost or non-monetary cost so valuation can be difficult and asset valuation differs from one organization to other will based on following factors like:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>cost to create or acquire, design, installation incl. maintenance</li>
    <li>cost to replace i.e. right now</li>
    <li>estimation or real costs protection against loss and litigation(fines and penalties) ✓ Value to owners users(critical success, profitability) ✓ worth to the competition (competitive advantage)</li>
    </ul>
    <h1><a id="How_to_do_Impact_Assessment_181"></a>How to do Impact Assessment?</h1>
    <p>After assets valuation, the next step is to identify potential loss in asset occur from the Risk In order to estimate of potential loss per risk. The questions that must be asked here include:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>What financial impact would occur due to damage?</li>
    <li>What would it cost to recover from the attack, in addition to the financial impact of damage? (The goal here is to calculate Single Loss Expectancy for each risk. )</li>
    </ol>
    <h1><a id="How_to_calculate_Single_Loss_Expectancy_S_L_E_186"></a>How to calculate Single Loss Expectancy (S L E)?</h1>
    <p>It is the estimation of loss occurred in a single asset because of a single risk.<br>
    S L E = Asset Value (A V) x Exposure Factor (E F)<br>
    Exposure Facture = % of potential loss to the organization caused by a specific threat. The exposure factor for a small asset will be less while for great value asset it will be more.</p>
    <h1><a id="How_to_calculate_Annual_Loss_ExpectancyA_L_E_191"></a>How to calculate Annual Loss Expectancy(A L E)?</h1>
    <p>A L E is the estimated yearly cost of loss of risk.<br>
    A L E = S L E (Single Loss Expectancy) X A R O (Annual Rate of Occurrence)<br>
    ARO is the expected frequency with which a specific threat or risk will occur (that is, become realized) within a single year. Higher the frequency of risk of the threat, Higher will be ARO.</p>
    <h1><a id="How_to_calculate_the_Cost_Benefit_Analysis_C_B_A_196"></a>How to calculate the Cost Benefit Analysis (C B A)?</h1>
    <p>Estimates, whether is a cost associated with control, is justifiable or not. It is calculated before control or safeguard is implemented, to determine if the control is worth implementing, and calculated after controls have been implemented and functioning for a time.<br>
    C B A = A L E (prior) - A L E (post) - ACS<br>
    ALE (prior to control) is the ALE of the risk before the implementation of the control. A L E (post control) is the A L E examined after the control has been in place for a period of time. A C S is the Annual Cost of the Safeguard</p>

    <li>What authorized users can access?</li>
    <li>When authorized users can access the system?</li>
    <li>Where authorized users can access the system from?</li>
    <li>How authorized users can access the system?</li>
    <li>Restricting what users can access, e.g., printers, files, communications, and applications? E.g.: Firewall(Filter,block, reduce)</li>

    <li>Mandatory Access Control
    <ul>
    <li>to protected highly classified data.</li>
    <li>used by government oriented agencies that maintain top-secret information</li>

    <h1><a id="What_is_Authentication_472"></a>What is Authentication?</h1>
    <p>process of validating a user identity There are four types of authentication mechanisms:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Something You Know: a password, passphrase, or some other unique authentication code like PIN.</li>
    <li>Something You Have: on basis of something that the user possesses. (a card,key, or token)</li>
    <li>Something You Are: identity based on a unique physical attribute that is evaluated by biometrics like fingerprint, facial recognition</li>
    <li>Something You Produce: action performed by users, like signature recognition and voice recognition. A strong authentication uses at least two different authentication mechanism types.(two-factor or multifactor authentication)</li>
    </ul>
    <h1><a id="How_to_evaluate_Biometrics_479"></a>How to evaluate Biometrics?</h1>
    <p>Biometric technologies are generally evaluated according to three basic criteria:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The false reject rate (FRR) /False Negative/ Type I Error: the percentage of authorized users who are denied access</li>
    <li>not a threat to security</li>
    <li>The false accept rate (FAR)/False Positive/ Type II Error: the percentage of unauthorized users who are allowed access</li>
    <li>a serious breach of security</li>
    <li>The crossover error rate (CER): the point at which the number of false rejections equals the false acceptances</li>
    <li>an optimal outcome</li>

    <ul>
    <li>Authorization for each authenticated user (complex and resource-intensive).</li>
    <li>Authorization for members of a group (most commonly used method).</li>
    <li>Authorization across multiple systems (‘single sign-on’)a central authentication and authorization system verifies entity identity and grants authorization.</li>

    <h1><a id="What_is_a_Firewall_497"></a>What is a Firewall?</h1>
    <p>In information security, a firewall is any device that prevents a specific type of information from moving between two networks, often the outside, known as the untrusted network (e.g., the Internet), and the inside, known as the trusted network.<br>
    The firewall may be a separate computer system, a service running on an existing router or server, or a separate network containing a number of supporting devices(DMZ).</p>
    <h1><a id="What_are_the_different_Firewall_Architectures_501"></a>What are the different Firewall Architectures?</h1>
    <ol>
    <li>Packet filtering Router First generation firewall. Packet filtering is a firewall technology that makes access decisions based upon header information of the packet. Header values include source and destination IP address, port numbers, protocol types, on the basis of which inbound and outbound traffic is controlled by the firewall. The main disadvantage is that they only inspect the header of the packet but not content, as well as header, can be spoofed.</li>
    <li>Screened-host firewalls Screened-host firewall systems combine the packet filtering router with a separate, application proxy server known as a bastion host.
    <ul>
    <li>The router is used to screen packets to minimize the network traffic and load on the internal proxy.</li>
    <li>The application proxy examines an application layer protocol, such as HTTP, Mail and performs the proxy services.</li>
    <li>This separate and single host, which is often referred to as a bastion host, represents a rich target for external attacks and should be very thoroughly secured.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Dual-homed host firewalls A dual-homed host architecture is built around the dual-homed host computer with two network interface: one that is connected to the external network, and one that is connected to the internal network. Use a dual-homed host as a firewall, you disable this routing function. A user wishing to access the trusted network from the Internet would log into the dual-homed host first, and then access the trusted network from there.</li>
    <li>Screened-subnet firewalls
    <ul>
    <li>The screened-subnet firewall consists of one or more internal bastion hosts located behind a packet filtering router, with each host protecting the trusted network. This raises the level of difficulty to penetrate the defense.</li>
    <li>One of the general models (in Figure 9-8) shows connections are routed as follows:
    <ul>
    <li>Connections from the outside or untrusted network are routed through an external filtering router</li>
    <li>Connections from the outside or untrusted network are routed into—and then out of—a routing firewall to the separate network segment known as the DMZ</li>
    <li>Connections into the trusted internal network are allowed only from the DMZ bastion host servers</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h1><a id="What_are_Intrusion_Detection_Systems_IDSs_515"></a>What are Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs)?</h1>
    <p>Tool for detecting unauthorized use of, or attack upon, a computer, network, or telecommunications infrastructure to mitigate damage by sending an alert on a network manager’s screen, or e-mail or even reconfiguring a firewall’s ACL setting. IDS have 3 components:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Sensors: collect network traffic and user activity data.</li>
    <li>Analyzer: determines suspicious activity based on rules.</li>
    <li>administrator’s interface: the terminal where sends an alert Like firewall systems, IDSs require complex configurations to provide the level of detection and response desired.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1><a id="What_is_a_HostBased_IDS_521"></a>What is a Host-Based IDS?</h1>
    <p>installed on individual workstations and/or servers to watch for inappropriate or abnormal activity usually used to provide alerts if users have delete system files, reconfigure important settings, or put the system at risk in any other way(e.g system folder). Reactive HIDS products are installed only on critical servers, not on every system on the network, because of the resource overhead and the administration hassle that such an installation would cause.</p>
    <h1><a id="What_is_a_NetworkBased_IDS_524"></a>What is a Network-Based IDS?</h1>
    <p>monitor network traffic when unusual activity occurs and then notify the appropriate administrator. (Packet sniffer) network IDPSs require a much more complex configuration and maintenance program than do host-based IDPSs.

    <h1><a id="What_is_Knowledge_or_Signaturebased_Intrusion_Detection_527"></a>What is Knowledge or Signature-based Intrusion Detection?</h1>
    <p>IDS vendor accumulate knowledge about different attacks and how they are carried out and develop a model known as Signatures. Each identified attack has a signature, which is used to detect an attack in progress or determine if one has occurred within the network. (land attack) Their effectiveness depends IDS is weak against new types of attacks as signatures are based on previously identified attack.</p>
    <h1><a id="What_is_Statistical_AnomalyBased_IDS_530"></a>What is Statistical Anomaly-Based IDS?</h1>
    <p>Knows as Behavioral-based IDS where it first collects data from network traffic and establishes a baseline. It then periodically samples network activity, based on statistical methods, and compares the samples to the baseline.<br>
    When the activity falls outside the baseline parameters (known as the clipping level), the IDS notifies the administrator. advantage of this approach is that the system is able to detect new types of attacks whose signature or fix has not been developed yet because it looks for the abnormal activity of any type. Disadvantage it is difficult to define what is normal when the network is constantly changing, it will create a lot of false positives. (attacker integrate his activities).</p>

    <p>RADIUS and TACACS are systems that authenticate the credentials of users who are trying to access an organization’s network via a dial-up connection. RADIUS has a central RADIUS server that centralizes the management of user authentication.<br>
    A Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) system centralizes the management of user authentication by placing the responsibility for authenticating each user in the central RADIUS server.<br>
    When a Remote Access Server (RAS) receives requests for a network connection from a dial-up client, it passes the request along with the user’s credentials to the RADIUS server; RADIUS then validates the credentials.</p>

    <li>To avoid bad thing happening(minimize the risk of error/omission/fraud) Types of Internal Controls;
    <ul>
    <li>Preventive: Detect problems before they arise (Example: Encryption, access control).</li>
    <li>Detective: Detect and report errors (Example: Reviewing logs).</li>
    <li>Corrective: Identify error, Minimize impact (Example: Contingency planning, backup Res.).</li>

    <ol>
    <li>Planning:
    <ul>
    <li>determine the objectives and scope of the audit.</li>
    <li>Risk Assessment:
    <ul>
    <li>Evaluate risk and internal controls.</li>
    <li>Compliance and Substantive testing.</li>
    <li>Developing checklists.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Scheduling( avoiding personnel absences and times of high activity).</li>
    <li>Kick off meeting(Interviews with the clients, point of contact, reporting mechanism).</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Fieldwork and Documentation:
    <ul>
    <li>Apply checklist i.e. carry out audit procedures.</li>
    <li>Determine risk and lapses in internal controls=Findings.</li>
    <li>Documentation(Working papers):
    <ul>
    <li>arrive valid conclusion?</li>
    <li>defense if the conclusion is challenged.</li>
    <li>learn from the experience.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Issue Discovery and Validation:
    <ul>
    <li>Report findings like potential risky issues, lacking mitigate controls.</li>
    <li>Timely reporting(correction timely and avoid confusion).</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Solution Development Three ways to provide a solution:
    <ul>
    <li>Recommendation Approach (Auditor Recommends but may not be effective).</li>
    <li>Management-Response Approach (Auditor report issue with or without recommendation asking for management response)<br>

    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>distribute reports (for response).</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Issue Tracking:
    <ul>
    <li>Audit Closure?</li>
    <li>track and follow up on issues until they are resolved.</li>
    <li>Escalation (Final resort).</li>
    <li>Validation .e.g. BCP plan.</li>

    <h1><a id="What_is_Audit_Trail_636"></a>What is Audit Trail?</h1>
    <p>A chronological record of any event or activities (log) Three types of logs:<br>
    1.System Logs: record events executed on an operating system, including miscellaneous events and those generated during system startup like hardware and controller failures.</p>
    <ol start="2">
    <li>Application Logs: record the events regarding access to the application . For e.g., events include reading, editing, deleting, or printing files.</li>
    <li>Security logs track security-related events like logon and logoff times and changes to access rights.</li>
    </ol>
    <h1><a id="What_is_Project_Management_642"></a>What is Project Management?</h1>
    <p>Project management is techniques to plan, organize, and monitor the project activities. Hence Project management is a process that is composed of:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Planning: Begins with a goal, sets standard (time, resources), suitable project leader and team.</li>
    <li>Monitoring and Controlling: Proactive Measure of the performance of the project against the standard.</li>
    <li>Closing: Project is terminated.</li>
    </ol>
    <h1><a id="What_is_Project_Plan_Development_648"></a>What is Project Plan Development?</h1>
    <p>Three core elements are used in the creation of a project plan: work time, resources, project deliverables Project.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Deliverables: are outcomes that are demonstrable. it’s a product, a process, a policy, or some other outcome. This specifies the roadmap of the project.</li>
    <li>Resources: includes people, equipment, supplies, materials, software, hardware depending on the project that needs to be quantified. (constraint or budget).</li>
    <li>Work Time: fixing start and deadline of the project which realistic based on its’ scope.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1><a id="What_are_the_Project_Planning_Considerations_654"></a>What are the Project Planning Considerations?</h1>
    <p>Special considerations include:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Finance (Budget, CBA).</li>
    <li>Priority (Priority of work package is determined by No of dependencies and Resource(experts) availability).</li>
    <li>Time And Schedule (Estimating a project schedule(PERT, GANTT chart)).</li>
    <li>Staff (Need to hire/employ enough qualified, trained, and other personnel).</li>
    <li>Procurement (purchasing goods or services from vendors, contractors, suppliers. Limited by Budget Constraints).</li>
    <li>Organizational Feasibility (Plan for change management like new policies, processes, technology and these can create tension and resistance).</li>
    <li>Training.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1><a id="What_is_the_Work_Breakdown_StructureWBS_664"></a>What is the Work Breakdown Structure(WBS)?</h1>
    <p>It breaks down the project scope into manageable deliverables known as work packages.</p>
